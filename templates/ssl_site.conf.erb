    ##   SSL Engine Switch:
    ##   Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
    SSLEngine on

    ##   SSL Protocol support:
    ## List the enable protocol levels with which clients will be able to
    ## connect.  Disable SSLv2 access by default:
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2

    ##   SSL Cipher Suite:
    ## List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
    ## See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
    SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL

    ##   Server Certificate:
    ## Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
    ## the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
    ## pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  A new
    ## certificate can be generated using the genkey(1) command.
    SSLCertificateFile <%= certfile %>

    ##   Server Private Key:
    ##   If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this
    ##   directive to point at the key file.  Keep in mind that if
    ##   you've both a RSA and a DSA private key you can configure
    ##   both in parallel (to also allow the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
    SSLCertificateKeyFile <%= certkey %>

    ##   Server Certificate Chain:
    ##   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
    ##   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
    ##   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
    ##   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
    ##   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
    ##   certificate for convinience.
    ##
    ##   Certificate Authority (CA):
    ##   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
    ##   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
    ##   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)V

    ##   Client Authentication (Type):
    ##   Client certificate verification type and depth.  Types are
    ##   none, optional, require and optional_no_ca.  Depth is a
    ##   number which specifies how deeply to verify the certificate
    ##   issuer chain before deciding the certificate is not valid.

    ##   Per-Server Logging:
    ##   The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a
    ##   compact non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis.
